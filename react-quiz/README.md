# React Quiz App

I would like to play with some React, and Typescript so i built a React Quiz app.

## Who is the user and how do they use it?

I am the user or you can use it too if you wish!

## Features

Makes a call to https://opentdb.com to return a dataset with questions which are mutated, shuffled, given to the user and scored. Score persists through question change in state and css is rendered via styled divs. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Given: i have downloaded and installed the program correctly, and the api is still working.
When: i click start an API call is made, which gathers a number of questions.
Then: those questions are saved.

Given: the api call was successful.
When: i click on one of the multiple possible options for the question.
Then: i am informed if i was correct and given a point, or not if i was incorrect then given the ability to move onto the next question.

## Instructions

* clone the repo
* npm install
* npm start
* visit the app at http://localhost:3000/
