# Modern React with Redux 2020 Course

This course is stated as being 52 hours of React and Redux videos, but it probably took three or four times that long to complete given the amount of notes that i had to write, videos i needed to rewind and bugs that i needed to find. However i thoroughly enjoyed the course and have learnt a tonne from it, so will be forever grateful!

<br>This repo contains my notes and projects from [Stephen Grinders Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/). It contains a huge amount of messy scribblings, of which i am fully aware should not go into production code, but this is my attempt to reinforce the lessons from his course and explain it to myself and is only on a public repo to demonstrate some of the study that i have been doing. 

During the course there have been multiple refactors, so some/many/most of the notes may no longer make sense, and some of my extracted notes on i.e. [React.md](./React.md) or [Redux.md](./Redux.md) may also be a total mess! But its just a tutorial, meant for my own education and the act of writing it down has been helpful.

### Future

I completed up and including section 28 of the 2020 course, which is all of the modern material, in the future i may return and do some of the old chapters (section 29+) which is duplicating what i have already done, but right now I do not feel the need to do so and feel the need to move onto something new.
