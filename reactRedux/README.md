## Features
React - a reconciler - knows how to work with components
ReactDom - a renderer - knows how to take instructions and HTML
state - data in the system, that may change over time.
useState - used to make react update the HTMl on the page
Babel - a command line tool that can take any version of Javascript and spit out a newer version of it. Its included in every new install of a React project. This is required as a web browser where the project is executed may not support newer versions of Javascript. It consists of a huge number or npm packages.
