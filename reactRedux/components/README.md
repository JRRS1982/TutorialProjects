## Creating a reusable configurable component
1. Identify the block that has been reused.
2. What is that block doing? Make a name for it.
3. Create a file with that name for the component.
4. Create a new component in the file, with that name and paste the JSX into it.
5. Make the component configurable by using Reacts props system.
