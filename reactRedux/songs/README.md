This is a song listing project that comes from Stephen Griders React with Redux 2020 tutorial, chapter 18.

It is a simple React app that renders some hard coded list of songs and duration, with a select button for the selection of one of those songs to the page.

- SongList: basic component to show a list of songs on the page.
- SongDetail: basic component to show detail of a a song on the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

Given i have a list of songs on the page.
When i click on a select button
Then i am provided further detail about that song on the page.

### <a name="reflection">Reflection and further development</a>

What went well: short project and a good introduction to redux, have worked in redux before, but this was a more detailed explanation, I learnt more about the connect, combineReducers and mapStateToProps functions.

What would i do differently: not cook apple and date chutney at the same time as this course, as i have had to get up every 15mins to give it a stir! :)

### Credits / team members

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise / tutorial project that i am completing to learn React/Redux.
