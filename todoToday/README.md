## Learning

What when well
- Enjoyed doing some vanilla JS with the DOM, have been working in mainly TS, with repetitive patterns recently.
- Liked the separation of 'selectors', 'event listeners' and 'functions'.

What could have gone better
- Was going to tdd the project so started out with a number of packages, then saw this tutorial and it had all the features I wanted so went through this for some practice.
