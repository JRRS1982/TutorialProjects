body-parser - middleware to parse a form 

by default a request object in Express does not have a body property, which is why we are using body-parser middleware. This brings in complications to Typescript, as typescript has no idea that the body-parser is adding properties to express. Therefore Typescript will not show errors middleware is used / it does not know what is going on in the middleware, we are using type definition files, and they may not be complete or may tell us the wrong type.
